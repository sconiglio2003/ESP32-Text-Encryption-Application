Introduction
  I wrote this program to encrypt and decrypt text. It also evolved into a brute force word guesser. The interface is through the Arduino IDE serial monitor. Be warned, it is very buggy - it was never
  intended to work on the serial monitor, it has only been adapted to do this. There is a much better version intendeded for the TFT ESP library, though it's an older version of the code.
